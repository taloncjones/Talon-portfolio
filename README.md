### PROJECTS

**[EA Account Creator](https://github.com/taloncjones/EAAccountCreator)** - _Python, Selenium_

- Planned and developed a project using Selenium that would automate the EA account creation process, turning a 5+ minute task into a process taking less than 30 seconds.
- Will use a Gmail account and app-specific password to automatically retrieve a verification code sent from EA, verify, and store the randomly generated account information in a google sheet.
- Reviewed and merged pull requests from another software developer.

**[Mini Twitch TV Player](https://github.com/taloncjones/Mini_TTV)** - _Python, Flask, React, MaterialUI_

- Developed Python back-end to utilize the Twitch API for user auth and data retrieval, and to return data in a JSON format.
- Developed React front-end to utilize JSON data and display it as a list of user-friendly stream/game objects. Users can navigate through top games/streams, see the streams they follow (if logged in), search for streams, and view streams.

**[Udacity Project: Item Catalog](https://github.com/taloncjones/LinuxCatalog)** - _Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PostgreSQL_

- Developed basic item catalog that allows user to view or modify (after third-party verification) an SQL database via CRUD operations.
