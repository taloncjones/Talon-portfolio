### EXPERIENCE

**Software Quality Assurance Engineer, Specialist** \
AT&T (Los Angeles, CA) \
July 2016 - Present

- Lead QA/DevOps Engineers to coordinate the development of comprehensive test plans; manage test priorities; identify, evaluate, and communicate risks and issues; ensure timely sprint deliveries. Results: Less overlap between different test groups, quicker bug identification and resolution, and speedier deliveries.
- Work closely with software engineers to determine and fix the root cause of issues. To date, issues include:
  - Identifying a major headend conflict estimated to have cost approx. \$1 million in revenue per month.
  - Detecting a cascading failure on a release candidate that would have impacted approx. 19 million customers.
- Created multiple test tools that have been adopted across multiple feature teams. Ex:
  - A bash-based iPerf test suite to automate network testing for new network products.
  - A suite of Bash and Python scripts to automatically update and configure set-top boxes, and other devices, with desired states. Daily software loading and configuration times cut by over 60%.
- Projects: BGW Modem/Router, Electronic Sell-Through, ModernUI, Dolby Atmos, DirectTV Now, AT&T Osprey, AT&T TV

**System Test Engineer, Team Lead** \
AT&T (Los Angeles, CA) \
March 2016 - July 2016

- Coordinated with project managers and 3rd party vendors to schedule, test, and resolve issues for 7 new products prior to production.
- Managed the resolution of 103 test incidents, at both a project and test level, for 4 products over the 5-month period.
- Planned and implemented a transition from the traditional waterfall test method to an Agile (Kanban) test method.
- Coordinated the development of lab infrastructure by planning the purchase and installation of 8 additional test racks. These were equipped with Apantac storage servers and screens, RedRat IR controllers, and STBs to facilitate mass automated testing. This setup has been adopted by most test groups.
- Projects: DSWM30, SL3/5 Reverse-Band LNBs

**System & Software Design Validation Engineer** \
DIRECTV/AT&T (Los Angeles, CA) \
July 2014 - March 2016

- Design, create, and execute test cases/scripts on TestLink to verify functionality and performance needs of new projects.
- Analyze internal and industry standard system specifications for new products so that they meet performance, usability, scalability, reliability, and security needs.

### PROJECTS

**[EA Account Creator](https://github.com/taloncjones/EAAccountCreator)** - _Python, Selenium_

- Planned and developed a project using Selenium that would automate the EA account creation process, turning a 5+ minute task into a process taking less than 30 seconds.
- Will use a Gmail account and app-specific password to automatically retrieve a verification code sent from EA, verify, and store the randomly generated account information in a google sheet.
- Reviewed and merged pull requests from another software developer.

**[Mini Twitch TV Player](https://github.com/taloncjones/Mini_TTV)** - _Python, Flask, React, MaterialUI_

- Developed Python back-end to utilize the Twitch API for user auth and data retrieval, and to return data in a JSON format.
- Developed React front-end to utilize JSON data and display it as a list of user-friendly stream/game objects. Users can navigate through top games/streams, see the streams they follow (if logged in), search for streams, and view streams.

**[Udacity Project: Item Catalog](https://github.com/taloncjones/LinuxCatalog)** - _Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PostgreSQL_

- Developed basic item catalog that allows user to view or modify (after third-party verification) an SQL database via CRUD operations.
- Implemented an API that allows users to fetch catalog content in JSON format.
